List
Lists is Mutable
It is Ordered collection of items
Items in list can be replaced or changed
SET
Set is Immutable
It is Unordered collection of items
Items in set cannot be changed or replaced
TUPLE	
Tuple is Immutable
It is Ordered collection of items
Items in tuple cannot be changed or replaced

12-strings aren’t mutable in python


13-it returns the number representing the Unicode of the character

x = ord("q")

print(x)
113


a = 10
print(a, "is of type", type(a))
Output-10 is of type <class 'int'>

It centralises and strengthen large amount of data from multiple sources. it allow organizations to derive valuable business insights from their data to improve decision-making.

OLAP
analyze data stored in a database
Large volume of data	
creates a single platform for all type of business analysis needs

OLTP
supports transaction-oriented applications in a 3-tier architecture
Large number of short online transaction
useful to administer day to day transactions of an organization

13-
Subject-oriented. They can analyze data about a particular subject or functional area.
Integrated.It create consistency among different data types from different sources.
Nonvolatile. Once data is stored, it’s stable and doesn’t change.
Time-variant.It analysis looks at change over time.

14- star schema

It is a relational schema, where a relational schema whose design represents a multidimensional data model.It is explicit data warehouse schema.It is known as star schema because the entity-relationship diagram of this schemas imitates a star, with points, branched from a central table. The center of the schema consists of a large fact table, and the points of the star are the dimension tables.

Set language is a very high level programming language, it is based on theory of set, it provide two basic aggregate data type sets and tuples.

IQR tells how spread out the middle values are it can also be used to tell when some of the other values are too far from the central value.These too far away points are called outliers,because they lie outside the range in which we expect them.

12-
they are both ensemble techniques,Bagging takes bootstrap samples of the data set and easch samples trains a weak learner wile boosting uses all data to train each learner.

13-
Adjusted R square calculate R square from only those variables whose addition in the model which are significant.

14-
NORMALISATION
It is used when features are of different scales.
affected by outliers
Scales values between [0, 1] or [-1, 1].

STANDARDISATION
used when we want to ensure zero mean and unit standard deviation.
much less affected by outliers
not bounded to a certain range

15-
It is a technique in which we train our model using the subset of the data-set and then assess using the complementary subset of the data-set.
main advantage is that it Reduces Overfitting but it increased the training time drastically as we have to train the model on multiple training sets
